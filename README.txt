OVERVIEW
========

Kofoto is an open source tool for organizing and viewing digital
images, typically photographs from a digital camera. Both graphical
and command-line interfaces are available.

With Kofoto, you can:

    * Organize images by use of categories (AKA "tags").
    * Organize images in an album tree.
    * Keep track of different versions of images.
    * Associate images with attributes.
    * Search for images matching a search expression.
    * View images.
    * Rotate images.
    * Generate HTML pages of an album tree. 

Kofoto is currently a bit rough on the edges, yet functional. But
please go ahead and try it, if you like!
