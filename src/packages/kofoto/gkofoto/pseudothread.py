class PseudoThread:
    """A pseudo thread using a GTK idle handler.

    This class provides a simple but powerful emulation of an activity
    that is run in a separate thread of control. That is, no actual
    thread is spawned. Instead, the thread-like behaviour is created
    by letting the GTK main loop call a function when idle. By letting
    the function be a generator object that yields quite often, the
    activity can easily remember its state between calls so that
    long-lived loops can be written without complex state machines.

    There are two ways to specify the activity: by passing a generator
    object ("the target") to the constructor, or by overriding the
    _run() method (which must be a generator) in a subclass.

    Once a PseudoThread instance has been created, its activity must
    be started by calling the start() method. After that, the target's
    next() method will be called repeatedly as long it returns a true
    value. If it returns a false value (or throws an exception), the
    activity is stopped (and will never be started again).

    To get a thread-like behaviour, the activity should not do
    anything that takes a long time before returning. If the activity
    needs to sleep, the sleep() method can be called, though.

    Usage examples:

    >>> import pygtk
    >>> pygtk.require("2.0")
    >>> import gtk
    >>> from kofoto.gkofoto.pseudothread import PseudoThread
    >>> def f(x):
    ...     for i in range(5):
    ...         print x, i
    ...         yield True
    >>> pt1 = PseudoThread(f("a"))
    >>> pt1.start()
    >>> pt2 = PseudoThread(f("b"))
    >>> pt2.start()
    >>> gtk.main()
    a 0
    b 0
    a 1
    b 1
    a 2
    b 2
    a 3
    b 3
    a 4
    b 4

    >>> import pygtk
    >>> pygtk.require("2.0")
    >>> import gtk
    >>> from kofoto.gkofoto.pseudothread import PseudoThread
    >>> class C(PseudoThread):
    ...     def _run(self):
    ...         print "sleeping..."
    ...         self.sleep(1000)
    ...         yield True
    ...         print "done."
    >>> pt = C()
    >>> pt.start()
    >>> gtk.main()
    sleeping...
    done.
