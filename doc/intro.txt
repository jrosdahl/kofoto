Crash course: How to register and generate your first album
===========================================================

Say you have a directory called myimages which contains images that
you want to generate an HTML album for in myphotoalbum. Do something
like this:

1. Initialize Kofoto:
   
       kofoto create-shelf

   This will create a database file called ~/.kofoto/shelf and a
   configuration file called ~/.kofoto/config.

2. Tell Kofoto where the images are:

       kofoto register root myimages

3. Generate the HTML album:

       kofoto generate root myphotoalbum

4. Point your web browser at myphotoalbum/index.html.
