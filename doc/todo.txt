* Ability to set JPEG quality (and progression?).

* Implement more magic albums.

    - Hierarchy of categories.

      The categories example above would render this hierarchy if there
      is one image (Image1) that has categories "Ryd" and "Ulrik":

          [A] Platser
              [A] Sverige
                  [A] Linköping
                      [A] Lambohov
                      [A] Ryd
                          [I] Image1
                  [A] Ulricehamn
                  [A] Örebro

          [A] Personer
              [A] Epact
                  [A] Ulrik
                      [I] Image1
              [A] Vänner
                  [A] Björn
                  [A] Ulrik
                      [I] Image1

    - Chronological with day granularity.

          [A] Chronological
              [A] 2003
                  [A] March 2003
                      [A] 17 March 2003
                          [I] Image1
                      [A] 19 March 2003
                          [I] Image2

* Generate details page.

* Make it possible to generate an album with images symlinked to a
  local image store, not the system-wide cache.

* Write a test suite.

* When generating an album, store images in per-month directories
  instead of the current two-level hash-based directory structure.

* Write setup.py.

* Write a simple, run-once client that creates a temporary shelf,
  registers images in given directories, generates an album and
  removes the shelf?

* Remove compatibility code for Python versions older than 2.3.

Think more about:

    * Which auxilliary attributes should be set on import? Specify
      default attributes (like photographer) to add in configuration?
      Ability to supply more/override attributes when importing?
