* Ability to set JPEG quality (and progression?).

* Implement more magic albums.

    - Hierarchy of categories.

      The categories example above would render this hierarchy if there
      is one image (Image1) that has categories "Ryd" and "Ulrik":

          [A] Platser
              [A] Sverige
                  [A] Linköping
                      [A] Lambohov
                      [A] Ryd
                          [I] Image1
                  [A] Ulricehamn
                  [A] Örebro

          [A] Personer
              [A] Epact
                  [A] Ulrik
                      [I] Image1
              [A] Vänner
                  [A] Björn
                  [A] Ulrik
                      [I] Image1

    - Chronological with day granularity.

          [A] Chronological
              [A] 2003
                  [A] March 2003
                      [A] 17 March 2003
                          [I] Image1
                      [A] 19 March 2003
                          [I] Image2

* Generate details page.

* Make it possible to generate an album with images symlinked to a
  local image store, not the system-wide cache.

* Two different generation modes: "local" and "symlink"? Generated
  HTML pages in the former mode would have absolute hrefs to the
  images in the imagecache and would be suitable for viewing with
  local web browser. Bonus: No need for symlinks, so it will work in
  Windows too. The latter would work as now, with symlinks to the
  imagecache (copies on Windows). A third mode that makes image copies
  regardless of platform could also be useful.

* Write a test suite.

* When generating an album, store images in per-month directories
  instead of the current two-level hash-based directory structure.

* Write a simple, run-once client that creates a temporary shelf,
  registers images in given directories, generates an album and
  removes the shelf?

* More output modules?

* Add possibility of giving an optional filter parameter when
  generating albums. Add default filter parameter. Example: Supplying
  the filter "not private" would exclude all images with the "private"
  category.

* Create some kind of graphic Windows client. A custom web server with
  an ordinary web client would probably do well.

* Parameterize output modules? It could be interesting to be able to
  tweak things like thumbnail size, image sizes, CSS, shadows, detail
  page generation, etc. on a per-generation basis.

* New search operators for finding images contained in a given album
  and albums that contain a given image.

* Make sure the stored Unicode text strings are normalized in the
  shelf.

* Split the location field in the image table into directory and
  filename. Add Shelf method for finding all images in a given
  directory. This method could be used by a client that wants to list
  missing images in a directory.

* Some kind of multiple image versions feature would be nice. An image
  that, for example, have been cropped or have had some color
  adjustments done probably should share most categories and
  attributes with the original image. Should the categories/attributes
  just be copied from the original image or should we store some kind
  of association in the shelf? LysKOM texts: 10395020, 10411412.

  Use case: I capture a picture, register it with Kofoto and add some
  categories and a description attribute. Later, I fix red eyes in the
  picture and want to register the edited picture too while keeping
  the original. I then want the categories and the description
  attribute to be inherited in some way.

* Rewrite image cache interface. LysKOM texts: 10411506 with comments.
  Executive summary: Store image location and timestamp (filesystem
  mtime) in addition to the MD5 checksum in the database. Use location
  and timestamp when looking up images in the cache instead of the
  checksum. This makes it possible to cache unregistered images too.

* Use ImageMagick/jpegtran if PIL isn't available?

* Make mapping of EXIF attributes to Kofoto attributes configurable.
  Add possiblity of reimporting EXIF attributes?

* Read "directories to ignore" from configuration.

* Add command for listing files in given directories that are known
  (registered) or unknown to Kofoto.

* Specify (in configuration) default attributes (like photographer) to
  add when registering images? Ability to supply more/override
  attributes when importing?

* Add switch for specifying search result format (id, filename, ...).

* Make gkofoto aware of the orientation attribute. Alternatively,
  remove handling of orientation from Kofoto altogether. Or make it
  configurable.

* Add possibility of supplying pairs of sizes (AxB) in the size
  options in ~/.kofoto/config. A pair specifies the rectangle that the
  image must fit in. A single size specifies the side of a square, as
  before.

* Fix inconsistencies in commandline client commands. LysKOM text:
  10994865.

* Define a transport format (XML-based?) for metadata. Add import and
  export commands.
