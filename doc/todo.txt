* Implement searching.

    Possibly via a search string in boolean algebra style? Example:
    "Linköping and Ulrik and (Björn or not Ryd)".

    Should it be possible to search for attribute values too?

    Ability to apply a search filter to exclude (or include) some
    pictures matching the filter when generating an album would also
    be nice.

* Cache database lookups.

* Ability to set JPEG quality (and progression?).

* Implement more magic albums.

    - Hierarchy of categories.

      The categories example above would render this hierarchy if there
      is one image (Image1) that has categories "Ryd" and "Ulrik":

          [A] Platser
              [A] Sverige
                  [A] Linköping
                      [A] Lambohov
                      [A] Ryd
                          [I] Image1
                  [A] Ulricehamn
                  [A] Örebro

          [A] Personer
              [A] Epact
                  [A] Ulrik
                      [I] Image1
              [A] Vänner
                  [A] Björn
                  [A] Ulrik
                      [I] Image1

    - Chronological with day granularity.

          [A] Chronological
              [A] 2003
                  [A] March 2003
                      [A] 17 March 2003
                          [I] Image1
                      [A] 19 March 2003
                          [I] Image2

* Generate details page.

* Make sure that the cache can handle lots of images (they are all
  stored in a single directory right now). And likewise for generated
  albums.

* Create configuration module. Use ConfigParser.

* Make it possible to generate an album with images symlinked to a
  local image store, not the system-wide cache.

* Store database strings in UTF-8 encoding.

Think more about:

    * Which auxilliary attributes should be set on import? Specify
      default attributes (like photographer) to add in configuration?
      Ability to supply more/override attributes when importing?
