Description: digital image organizer and viewer
 Kofoto is a tool for organizing and viewing digital images, typically
 photographs from a digital camera. Images can be organized in an
 album hierarchy and associated with categories organized in a
 powerful category tree with no limits on depth or size. Images can be
 found by searching for any combination of categories and image
 attributes. Web photo albums of an album hierarchy can also be
 generated. Both command-line and graphical, GTK+-based interfaces are
 available.
